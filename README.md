# Destify Proposal
## Introduction
Welcome to my proposal for Destify! I'm excited to share my skills and ideas for enhancing your website. My proposal focuses on using Bootstrap 4, HTML5 & CSS3, and integrating Google Maps to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.

For this project, I've based my work on an existing template and improved it to better suit Destify's needs. Additionally, I've optimized the code, reducing five web pages to just one, making the website more efficient and easier to maintain.

## Skills Showcase

### Bootstrap 4
Bootstrap 4 is a powerful front-end framework that I'll use to create a responsive and visually appealing design for Destify. Its grid system, components, and utilities will ensure consistency and efficiency in development.

### HTML5 & CSS3
I'll leverage the latest features of HTML5 and CSS3 to enhance the structure, layout, and styling of the website. This includes semantic markup, CSS animations, and responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across devices.

### Google Maps Integration
By integrating Google Maps, I'll provide users with an interactive way to explore destinations, view routes, and find nearby attractions. This feature will enhance the user experience and add value to your website.

### Next Steps
For the next steps, I propose to migrate the existing web page to TypeScript. TypeScript offers static typing and enhanced tooling, which will improve code quality, maintainability, and scalability of the project.

### Conclusion
I believe that my skills in Bootstrap 4, HTML5 & CSS3, and experience with Google Maps integration make me a strong candidate to enhance Destify's website. I look forward to discussing this proposal further and working together to create a fantastic user experience. 

I believe in honesty, respect, empathy, responsibility, ethics, and enthusiasm, which align with Destify's values. I also have ideas for improving remote work, like using agile Scrum in all departments and having short meetings for coworkers to get to know each other better.

I'm excited about the opportunity to join Destify and help the team succeed.

Thank you for considering my proposal.
